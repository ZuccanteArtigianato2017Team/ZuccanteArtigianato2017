================================

.PNG - Programmers of New Generation

![](https://readthedocs.org/projects/png-arduino-framework/badge/?version=latest)


## About

PNG Framework was developed by students of Unesp - University of the State of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, with the goal to turn Arduino project development easier. The framework has a chain of modular classes, compatible with some Arduino components. 


## Roadmap

We have to organize all modules, write some tutorials and publish it. It will take some time...


## Libraries

This version supports some Arduino components:

* Bluetooth
* [LED Matrix - 74HC595/74HC138](http://www.elabpeers.com/led-matrix-display.html)
* Motor
* Arduino Timer/Thread
* Ultrasonic

## Installation

1. Download the master branch from GitHub.
2. Unzip it
3. Move all folders to your Library folder (On your `libraries` folder inside Sketchbooks of Arduino software).


## Contribute

This library still under development. We need help adding new components and testing with differents Arduino and components versions. 
Any help will be appreciated :)
